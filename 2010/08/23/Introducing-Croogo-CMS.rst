Introducing Croogo CMS
======================

Croogo is a free, open source, content management system powered by
CakePHP framework.
A few of you may already know about this project, but I thought it
would be better to let everyone in the CakePHP community know about it
via The Bakery.


The Beginning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Back in 2008, I started developing applications for clients in
CakePHP. And most of the projects required basic CMS features like
pages, blog, contact forms, user management, etc. I realized I was
spending extra time by coding the same thing for every project. So I
decided to develop a CMS of my own that I can use as a starting point
for my future projects.

I started developing Croogo in early 2009, but I made it open source
in October hoping it would benefit the CakePHP community as well as
the project itself.


Why CakePHP?
````````````

Once you adopt MVC style of development, it is really very difficult
for you to go back and code in PHP the normal way. And considering
other major PHP frameworks, I found CakePHP easier to learn.


Inspiration
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are hundreds of CMS out there. But very few are developed
utilizing popular MVC frameworks. I made a research on other open
source CMS in the market, and ended up with this finding:


+ Wordpress has an easy to use admin interface
+ Drupal gives you more control over content
+ Joomla! is easy for administrators when it comes to extending it

I kept these three things in mind when developing Croogo.


Features
~~~~~~~~

It covers most of the basic features that you would look for in a CMS.
You can find the full list here:
`http://wiki.github.com/croogo/croogo/features`_.

Here is a summarized list:


+ Content : You can create your own content types. Default types are
  blog, page and node.
+ Taxonomy : categorization of your content
+ WYSIWYG editor (with integrated file/image uploads)
+ Custom Fields for content
+ Multilingual : content in multiple languages (i18n)
+ Comments
+ Syndication (rss feeds)
+ Menu manager
+ Blocks
+ Contact forms
+ File manager
+ User management (includes ACL management for setting permissions)
+ Themes
+ Extensions manager : manages uploading/activating of Plugins, Themes
  and Locales
+ Web based installer



Roadmap
~~~~~~~

I have released version 1.2 today. Now the goal is to set up the
website with proper documentation and also prepare for the next
release, which includes migrating the project to CakePHP 1.3. Next
version may also include a redesign of the admin panel.
