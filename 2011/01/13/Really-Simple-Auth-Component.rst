Really Simple Auth Component
============================

Since the first releases of CakePHP, the authentication component
seemed overkill for small projects, where simple
user/pass/access_level is required, so I decided to create this simple
Authentication component to allow simple User access level on all our
apps. The aim is to keep the component as simple as possible that can
be implemented in less than 10 minutes along your site.

Component is called bAuth, and is very simple to use. It will allow
you to perform the following tasks in your applications with very
little code.

#. Authenticate users, based on Username/Password and access level
#. Restrict access to certain Controller functions based on access
   level
#. Handle Sessions, and store basic user information in the Session

In next releases it will also allow to perform Cookie Based
authentication and password remembering.

You can find and download the latest release from the Google Code
page, here: `http://code.google.com/p/cakephp-bauth/`_
