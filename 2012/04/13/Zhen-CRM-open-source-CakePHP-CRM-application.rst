While this does not have the complicated features of enterprise CRMs,
it has the basic features that most small businesses could use - such
as contacts, tasks, "deals" and a calendar.

In contrast to the many other commercial CRM solutions available on
the market, this is free, simple and can be installed on one's own
servers or shared hosts.
