CakeFest 2013: San Francisco, USA
=================================

Join us at CakeFest 2013, the annual CakePHP conference, held this
year in San Francisco, from the 29th of August until the 1st of
September, and experience open source at it's very best! Visit
http://cakefest.org for info and tickets.


One event for everything CakePHP
--------------------------------

We want to celebrate 8 years of CakePHP with you and the whole
community, and how better than to host our annual conference in the
awesome city of San Francisco! Don't miss out on this unique event
dedicated to the framework.


Workshops
~~~~~~~~~

The 2 days of workshops at CakeFest are an ideal opportunity to learn
the ins and outs of CakePHP, and a great way to get up to speed with
the latest versions and innovations from the framework. Attendees will
also receive their own certificate of attendance. This year we have
both basic and advanced workshops, ranging from getting the most out
of CakePHP, to going deep into the internals of the project, allowing
both beginners and veterans to get a piece of the cake!


Conference
~~~~~~~~~~

Covering 2 fully packed days of keynotes, presentations and talks on
CakePHP and related technologies, the conference portion of CakeFest
is an event not to be missed, for both new and old users of the
framework. It's a great time to engage and network with the community,
learn from other experienced developers, and party with the core team!
See `http://cakefest.org/schedule`_ for more details.

this the biggest and best CakePHP conference ever! These people,
