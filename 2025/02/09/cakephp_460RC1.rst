CakePHP 4.6.0-RC1 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the first release candidate for
CakePHP 4.6.0. The 4.6 release includes features backported from 5.1 and the
upcoming 5.2 releases. 4.6.0 is a smaller release, as the core team's focus is
on 5.x now. 4.x feature releases are now driven by primarily by community
involvement. The highlights of what is new in 4.6 include:

- ``RedisEngine`` now supports a ``tls`` option for connecting to redis via
  a TLS connection.
-  ``Number::formatter()`` and ``currency()`` now support a ``roundingMode``
  option to control how rounding is handled.

What's new in 4.6.0
-------------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/appendices/4-6-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.6.0.

How you Can Help
----------------

You can help deliver 4.6.0 by contributing in one of many ways:

#. Check the `documentation <https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/>`_ for mistakes,
   outdated, unclear or broken examples. We've been trying to update the
   documentation as we go, but there are likely examples or sections we've
   missed.
#. Try it out! Give CakePHP 4.6.0 a test drive. Let us know how upgrading
   went and if there were any rough spots.
#. File issues for regressions in existing features, or suggest new features.
