Adopting an IDE for CakePHP
===========================

It is a just a wishing! I hope that the CakePHP community able to
surprise us with adopting a free PHP IDE such as Eclipse or Netbeans
and supply it with required plugins and extension that allow it to
offer a complete and full support for CakePHP.

Complete and full support, means that it should able to do the
following two points:

#. Creating new project from scratch in a GUI wizard manner
#. The ability to auto-complete any aspect of multiple choices in the
   code, such as $components, $helpers, $this->Session, $this->ModelName,
   etc


I think such step will increase the popularity of CakePHP and it will
short the learning curve, beside introducing off-line, searchable and
downloadable media of documentation and API
