CakePHP 1.3.10 released
=======================

Today we're excited to release CakePHP 1.3.10, which emerges hot on
the heels of CakePHP 1.3.9 to addresses a specific issue with cookie
deletion that emerged in CakePHP 1.3.9.

This release contains 10 commits, and 3 bug fixes.

An addition has been made to check for URL Rewriting capabilities on
your web server, providing a helpful message with links to the CakePHP
book for assistance to configure URL rewriting.

The XML class previously incorrectly processed elements with children
for slugging, this has also been fixed.

Further to these updates, more testing has been aded to ensure the
functionality of the Media view, as well as correct handling for
uppercase file extensions.

Finally, we've added the test suite icons to the distribution meaning
that offline testing gives you pretty pictures in the test suite!

CakePHP 1.3.10 is a short release, but we're glad to be able to get
these fixes and enhancements out to the community quickly. We hope you
enjoy it!
