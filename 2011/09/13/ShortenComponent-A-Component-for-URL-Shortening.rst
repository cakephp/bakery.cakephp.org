ShortenComponent - A Component for URL Shortening
=================================================

I needed a way to generate Short URL's for my blog posts (like
WordPress is able to do) on-the-fly, this ShortenComponent was what I
came up with, supporting a range of URL shorteners. I'm putting it
here in hopes that someone finds it useful.
Just for those interested, here's the `the original article`_ on my
blog.
Thanks,
Well, I've made my first CakePHP (1.3+) Component, it's for URL
Shortening and currently supports a number of shorteners such as:

+ kwn.me (and all kwn.me powered domains)
+ bit.ly
+ goo.gl (thanks to `Fabrcio Ferracioli's`_ Component)
+ YOURLS (custom domains, API needs to be enabled.)

You can find usage cases here:
`http://onemorefunction.com/blog/examples/shorten`_

You can download the actual component file here:
`https://github.com/MadMikeyB/CakePHP-Scrapbook/blob/master/components/shorten.php`_

Also, please remember to fill out all API Keys, before use. They're
marked with REPLACEME. If they're not filled out you'll just get
"error".

Feel free to fork it on GitHub, or suggest changes.
