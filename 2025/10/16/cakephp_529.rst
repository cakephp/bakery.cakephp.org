CakePHP 5.2.9
==============

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
5.2.9. This is a maintenance release for the 5.2 branch that fixes several
community reported issues and regressions.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 5.2.9. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/5.2.7...5.2.9>`_ for every commit.

* Improve PHPUnit usage in tests.
* Fixed DI integration for Components.
* ``TableLocator`` can now fetch table instances by full class name.
* Fixed default value reflection and for SQLite boolean columns.
* Fixed how ``Socket`` detects connection interruptions, by deprecating
  ``$connected`` property, and using ``is_resource()`` instead. This should
  improve behavior of ``SmtpTransport`` in long running processes.
* Improved typehints for ``SelectQuery``.
