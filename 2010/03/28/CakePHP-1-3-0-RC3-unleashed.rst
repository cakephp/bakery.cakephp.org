The CakePHP development team is happy to announce the release the
CakePHP 1.3.0-RC3. This release is the second last release candidate
for 1.3.0. Since 1.3.0-RC2 was released 2 weeks ago there have been
over 80 commits and 35 tickets fixed. The plan is to have one more
release candidate, and then 1.3.0 stable. After 1.3.0 stable is
released it will enter a maintenance period similar to 1.2.

There have been no major features added since the last Release
Candidate. There has been a minor change in Model::saveAll(). By
default it will do a validate = first by default now. This was done to
resolve unexpected behavior differences between Model::save() and
Model:saveAll().

In other project news, the API has been updated to no longer require
Javascript to view formatting. Additionally more internal links have
been created. The 1.3 book has been receiving a healthy amount of
translation attention. There is now greatly expanded documentation in
German, French and Vietnamese. To everyone who has contributed thank
you and keep up the good work.

We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed documentation, tickets
and code between the last release and now.
