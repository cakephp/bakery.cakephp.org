Versioned DbMigrations
======================

Need more control than only just being able to update your database
schema via CakePHP's Migration shell ? Well, this is a dirty quick
solution for actually versioning your database ! And a great tool to
let all developers on your CakePHP project to keep their respective
databases up-to-date. You can choose to either do this auto-magically,
or use the plugin's GUI to go back and forth between versions at will.
The best part is that it utilizes CakePHP's "Model" layer to it's
fullest, hence you can practically do anything when you jump from
version to version.

CakePHP: Versioned Db Migrations Plugin for CakePHP 2.0
============================================================

Installation



Install this plugin following the simple steps below:

#. Copy this plugin in a directory called "DbMigrations" inside your
   app/Plugin directory.
#. Now load the plugin in your application's bootstrap file (typical
   location: app/Config/bootstrap.php) by pasting this line:


::

    CakePlugin::load('DbMigrations');


#. After this, take a look at DbMigrations/Config/config.php. Here you
   will find two setting:


::

    table => 'db_migrations'
    and sanityCheck => true
    
    These settings are as simple as they sound. The "table" is the name of the table the DbMigrations plugin is going to use.
    You can change it to your liking.
    The second setting: "sanityCheck", when turned to "TRUE" lets DbMigrations check if the table specified in the "table"
    property exists. If not, it simply creates it so that you won't have to do a thing :)


#. After following the above steps, there are two ways in which you
   can keep your databases up-to-date.


::

    4.1. You can simply paste this line "ClassRegistry::init('DbMigrations.Migration')->upgrade(true)" in your AppController::beforeFilter().
         Following this way, whenever your you hit a page, the AppController::beforeFilter() will be executed, hence, the DbMigrations plugin
         will update your database to the latest version if it's not already.
    
    4.2. OR you can go to the plugin's GUI, http://your_website_url/db_migrations/migrations and choose the revision you'd like
         your database to be updgraded or downgraded to.

NOTE: I won't recommend using both 4.1 or 4.2 at the same time.

And you're all set ! - Also, I would always advise to keep this kind
of auto-upgrades for environments like Test and Development. It won't
be good practice at all to use this for production. Fits the dev
environment best though.

How this works
B0x1A6
So to get started, after when you have followed the installation steps
make a folder "Migrations" in your "app" directory. You will find a
"Migrations" folder already in the "DbMigrations" directory. That is
the default folder. You'd be better off keeping your files organized
in a folder in your app dir for better organization. (In future
versions I can have that folder name and path configurable too).

A sample file list in the "Migrations" folder would look like this:

::

    001_initial_db_dump.php
    002_users_table_add_deleted_field.php
    003_create_samples_table.php
    004_changes_for_issue_336.php

There are two parts to the files you create. As you can see, the name
of the files that is prefixed by a version number. These version
numbers need to be unique as it's going to be an incremental updates
for the database.

Now to look inside a sample file. For, say, the second file,
"002_users_table_add_deleted_field.php", the contents would be simply:

::

    class DbMigration_2 extends DbMigrationsAppModel {
    
        public function up() {
            $sql = "ALTER TABLE  `users` ADD  `deleted` TINYINT( 1 ) NOT NULL";
            $this->query($sql);
        }
    
        public function down() {
            $sql = "ALTER TABLE `users` DROP `deleted`";
            $this->query($sql);
        }
    }

After making all the changes (following steps in the installation) and
making these files, if you are following step 4.1 to update your
database, then when you run your application for the first time, it
will run all these files, hence pushing all changes in your database.

If you notice, you'll see that all "DbMigration_{$revisionNumber}"
classes are instances of the CakePHP Model. Hence you can use
CakePHP's model layer to it's full potential !

If at any point in time, say you need to downgrade your changes to a
specific revision number, assuming 2 for this explanation. All you
need to do is execute this statement at any suitable place in your
code:

::

    ClassRegistry::init('DbMigrations.Migration')->downgrade(2);

This will rollback all changes till revision 2. Which means it will
drop the table "samples" (you should code the drop statement in the
downgrade() function of DbMigration_3 class).

If you wish to make your database up-to-date again, then just issuing
the upgrade() statement, it will re-create the samples table and push
all changes for issue 336. It won't execute changes for files 001 and
002.

OR alternatively, you can follow step 4.2.

Important Notes

You will need to be carefuly to name your DbMigration_X classes, that
"X" should correspond to the revision number that is prepended to
every migration file.

There are no checks implemented at this point. No exceptions if you
screw up. So you will really need to be careful in coding the up() and
down() functions for your DbMigration_X classes.

You can also even insert data into tables and issue update statements.

Hope this plugin makes your life easier and makes development fast !
