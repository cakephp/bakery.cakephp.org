Document Manager Plugin for CakePHP 2.x
=======================================

This plugin offers the the possibility to have an online browser
allowing to manage files inside a directory tree. You can upload,
rename, delete files, create folders, get the absolute URL of a file
and much more...

The Document Manager plugin provides an out of the box simple file
management interface for any CakePHP 2.x application.

You define a base directory inside the webroot folder for your
arborescence and inside you can create folders, upload/rename/delete
files, browse them, obtain the absolute URL of any file in order to be
able to link to it. Uploaded files informations are stored inside a
Document table which allows to easily access them in your application.

Moreover it can be hooked to an user management system to manage
ownership of files and prevent files edition or deletion by other
users. If you do not have an user management system, you can easily
disable file ownership management to have an open system.

It requires jQuery and jQuery-UI to perform. It is styled with
Bootstrap.
