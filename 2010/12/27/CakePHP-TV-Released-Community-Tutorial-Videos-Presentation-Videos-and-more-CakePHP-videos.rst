CakePHP TV Released! Community Tutorial Videos, Presentation Videos,
and more CakePHP videos
=======================

I would like to welcome everyone to CakePHP TV, a community driven
video site dedicated to all videos CakePHP.
The CakeDC Team is very excited about the release of CakePHP TV 1.0!
We wanted to develop an application that would maximize outreach to
the CakePHP community; an application that is home to a collection of
videos produced by the CakePHP community, for the community.

Readily available on CakePHP TV are a number of features designed for
you to seamlessly familiarize yourself with:

-Vote and Comment on videos

-Suggest New Video Ideas to the Community

-Vote and Comment on Ideas for New Videos

-Accept a New Video Idea and produce a video of your own

CakePHP TV covers all skill levels of CakePHP developers. You can
contribute to the CakePHP community, even if you are a beginner, by
suggesting New Video Ideas[2] to the community. New Video Ideas are
given an opportunity to be produced after being evaluated by the
community through votes and comments.

If you are a more advanced CakePHP developer and want to contribute a
video, you can 'Accept' a popular New Video Idea and produce it.
Publishing a popular Video Idea will receive much kudos from the
community in the form of comments and votes.

We hope you enjoy CakePHP TV!
