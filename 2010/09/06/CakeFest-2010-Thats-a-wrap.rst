CakeFest 2010: Thats a wrap
===========================

CakeFest 2010 has come to a close. After 4 days of jam-packed talks,
workshops, lightning talks and social outings, we're sad to see it
finish.
CakeFest 2010 has come to a close. After 4 days of jam-packed talks,
workshops, lightning talks and social outings, we're sad to see it
finish.

I'd like to thank the community for their ongoing and ever increasing
support. Both for the community and for the CakeFest conference
itself. Without the passionate community around CakePHP, we couldn't
achieve events like CakeFest 2010.

This year saw a huge interest from sponsors in CakeFest 2010. From
large to small businesses, and even in a time of financial hardship
worldwide, businesses are seeing the benefits in supporting events
like CakeFest 2010 and in supporting open source overall. The generous
contributions from all our sponsors ensured the success of this years
event, and we'd like to thank each of them for their support this
year:


+ `CakeDC`_ (Diamond Sponsor)
+ `Microsoft`_ (Gold Sponsor)
+ `O'Reilly Media`_ (Silver Sponsor)
+ `WidgetPress`_ (Silver Sponsor)
+ `GitHub`_ (Silver Sponsor)
+ `Loadsys`_ (Exhibitor)
+ `FluidLino Creative`_ (Supporter)
+ `ActiveState`_ (Supporter)
+ `Affilorama`_ (Supporter)
+ `Traffic Travis`_ (Supporter)
+ `Guestlist`_ (Supporter)

We've had some outstanding responses from everyone that has attended.
The adaptive nature of the workshops was well received, as we adjusted
day 2 to meet the specific needs of the community.

We have a huge range of photos from the event here:

The gorgeous cake that we had custom made on Sunday was from Tipsy
Cake (`http://tipsycakechicago.com`_).
