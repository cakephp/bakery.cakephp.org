The CakePHP development team presents CakePHP 1.3.0. After a solid

next version of CakePHP stable. This next instalment of the CakePHP
line brings a myriad of enhancements, fixes and structural changes to
the framework designed to ease your development experience and extend
the capabilities of CakePHP.

The documentation accompanying CakePHP 1.3 far exceeds any previous
release. The development, enhancement and change process has been
meticulously documented to ensure a seamless upgrade path is available
from CakePHP 1.2.x. While most applications will be able to make this
transition with minimal changes, those that need migration will find
the process far easier than previous releases. A summary of CakePHP
1.3 [1] is available as well as a comprehensive migration guide [2]
and a full list of new features [3].

The API [4] has been updated to the 1.3.0 release version to correctly
reflect the changes in documentation and code. The CakePHP Cookbook
has its own 1.3.x branch for documentation [5], which has been updated
in numerous sections to reflect the changes and updates within this
new release. The cookbook is heavily driven by user submissions. If
you see an issue within the cookbook, or feel that a section could be
extended or added to, please feel free to submit a change.

This release comprises 39 commits and 20 tickets closed.

As we push forward, the development teams efforts will be focused on
CakePHP 2.0 and beyond. Soon a roadmap, release plan, and associated
documentation, API and change details will be made available. CakePHP
1.3 will be updated as necessary to correct issues if they arise,
enhancements are being pushed over to 2.0 as we push forward with
development.

We'd like to thank everyone that submitted bug reports, pull requests,
documentation updates, API changes, helped out in the IRC channel and
everyone that continues to contribute, promote and use the CakePHP
framework.
