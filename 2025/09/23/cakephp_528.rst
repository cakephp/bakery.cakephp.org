CakePHP 5.2.8
==============

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
5.2.8. This is a maintenance release for the 5.2 branch that fixes several
community reported issues and regressions. 5.2.8 also contains a fix for
a potential security issue in the query builder. When using **already executed** queries as
subquery expressions, bound parameter values were overwritten which could lead
to inccorrect query results. Other usage of subqueries are not impacted.

I'd like to welcome `josbeir <https://github.com/josbeir>`_ to the CakePHP team.
They have been actively been developing a refesh of the documentation. You can
see a development preview of the documentation at
`newbook.cakephp.org <https://newbook.cakephp.org/>`_.
