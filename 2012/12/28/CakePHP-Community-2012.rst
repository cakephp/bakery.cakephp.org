CakePHP Community 2012
======================

2012 was the year CakePHP turned 7 years old, maintaining it's reign
as one of the major PHP frameworks.


CakePHP: a framework built and shaped by the community
------------------------------------------------------

2012 was an important year for CakePHP. Versions `2.1`_ and `2.2`_ of
the framework were released, and work on the future `3.0`_ version
began. We had over 7 million combined visits to the CakePHP sites,
with over half of those being new visitors. More than 17 million page
views were registered for the CookBook alone, with
`https://book.cakephp.org`_ being the most popular location of all.

`CakeFest`_ 2012 saw some excellent guest speakers, with people from
across the globe who couldn't make it tuning in and watching the event
via streaming video. We also got a lot of feedback this year from the
community, prompting us to create official `Facebook`_, `Google`_ and
`LinkedIn`_ groups for CakePHP, to help people stay in touch with the
latest news and discussions.

We also gathered some interesting demographics to share with you all,
for the people who were most active and influential with CakePHP in
2012.

The top 5 communities, based on country, were the following:

#. United States
#. Brazil
#. India
#. France
#. Japan

They were followed by Germany, United Kingdom, Canada and Spain, with
the number one city based upon engagement world wide being Tokyo,
Japan.

Additionally, the top 5 languages were the following:

#. English (en-us/gb)
#. Portuguese (pt-br)
#. French (fr)
#. Spanish (es)
#. Japanese (ja)

It was also interesting to see that 45% of the community who engaged
with us were aged between 25-34, followed by 30% from 18-24, and the
remaining over 34 or under 18. The gender difference was around 10%
female and 90% male.

And finally, based upon browser usage, Chrome came out on top, with
46% of all visits to the CakePHP site. It was followed by Firefox
(34%), Safari (9%) and IE (6%).

Of course, these statistics are just numbers. The reality is that
every single person who contributes to CakePHP, no matter where you
are, or which language you speak, male of female, you are important.
That's why we thank each and every one of you for making CakePHP what
it is today - a framework created by the community! Thank you.
