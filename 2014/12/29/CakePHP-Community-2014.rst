CakePHP Community 2014
======================

2014 again beat everyone's expectations, with the CakePHP community
growing around the world.


3.0: the evolution of a PHP framework
-------------------------------------

If anything were to have marked 2014 for `CakePHP`_ we'd probably all
agree it was `3.0`_, the latest major version of the framework in it's
10 year lifetime. After a series of `successful`_ `developer`_
`previews`_ and `several`_ `beta`_ `releases`_, we're now in position
to freeze the API inline for a final stable version, just after
community review of the release candidates.

It's been a `long way`_ to get where we are right now, but the
direction taken has advanced the framework, and brought it `inline`_
with what developers have been asking for. There have been some
`significant`_ `changes`_ and `great`_ `new`_ `additions`_, as well as
some `important`_ decisions, but we truly feel this best represents
the community's expectations as a whole, and prepares us for the next
generation of CakePHP applications.

So far, this year has seen 30+ releases, including versions `2.5`_ and
`2.6`_ of the framework, and over `120`_ releases to date. This was
made possible by some `290`_ contributors to the project, and that
doesn't even count the more than `360`_ contributors to the
documentation. Above all, CakePHP continues to be ranked in the top 5
most popular PHP frameworks on GitHub by developers.

The project has also begun to increase it's modularity even further by
splitting the core framework into `modules`_ (or packages), which
allow aspects of CakePHP to be remixed with other projects. This
hasn't stopped people from being inspired by the framework in the
past, even Doctrine gave us a hat tip with their `Inflector`_ class.
All in all, this just shows how committed we really are about
contributing back to the Open Source community as a whole, while
allowing developers to use the best of CakePHP where they see fit.

The community effect
--------------------

On the social side of things we now have over 15,000 likes on
`Facebook`_ as well as some 12,000 followers on `Twitter`_. There were
also `various`_ `book`_ `released`_ this year, accompanied by the
launch of both the official `podcast`_ and `certification`_ platform
by the `Cake Software Foundation`_.

We saw some great `talks`_ and `presentations`_ on CakePHP,
`numerous`_ `interviews`_ and `podcasts`_, `lots`_ `of`_ `blog`_
`posts`_ and `many`_ `tutorials`_, developers giving their own
`personal`_ `experiences`_ with the project, as well as a community
curated list of `awesomeness`_ and some stunning displays of
`contribution growth`_ and `developer dedication`_. We've also
witnessed the community grow in terms of developer organized meetups,
with events now taking place in locations such as the `Netherlands`_,
`France`_, `Germany`_, `Ahmedabad`_, `Tokyo`_ and `New York`_.

A conference to remember
------------------------

On the topic of events, `CakeFest`_ 2014, the annual CakePHP
conference, was held this year in Madrid, Spain. The event, covering 4
days of workshops and conference, left us with `lots of`_ `memorable`_
`moments`_. It also had some `really`_ `amazing`_ `reviews`_ as well
as `some`_ `awesome`_ `feedback`_ `from`_ `the`_ `community`_.

It was by far one of our biggest turn-outs ever, with an incredible
line-up of high profile speakers, and an awesome array of sponsors,
including `CakeDC`_, `Microsoft Azure`_, `GitHub`_, `Rackspace`_,
`O'Reilly`_, `JetBrains`_, `Packt Publishing`_, `NuSphere`_,
`Loadsys`_, `SANIsoft`_, `ZenServ`_, `Broadband Finder`_ and
`Intersective`_.

The slides for the `community keynote`_ are available, or you can
listen to it on an `episode`_ of the CakePHP podcast. More talks and
slides from the conference days can also be found `here`_, or `check`_
`out`_ `images`_ from the event. And finally, a big shout-out to
everyone who joined us for 2014, we hope to see you all again next
year for another incredible gathering of the CakePHP community!

Drawing to a close
------------------

Looking back, this year has been a remarkable year for us. Without a
doubt, and after 10 long years, CakePHP still remains a `very`_
`popular`_ framework for PHP development. It's the direct result of a
community working together!

If you've contributed to the project, in any manner, shape or form,
then feel proud that you've played a part in this awesome social
experiment we call Open Source. Words aren't enough to express our
gratitude, so all we can say is... Thank You.
