960 Fluid Grid System Bake Templates
====================================

Want to use 960 grid system in your baked app? Ever see this "fluid"
template that uses it?
[url]http://www.designinfluences.com/fluid960gs[/url] - I put it into
some bake templates.
It's not that I don't like the default baked views, but I wanted
something more generic and flexible. This template is extremely fast
to work with too. You can add more boxes and other content very easily
as opposed to the default bake templates.

If you are unfamiliar with the 960 Fluid Grid System template created
by Stephen Bau, then check out the link in the intro. It's a very
clean and basic gray/black/white layout with some nice collapsible
divs and accordions and such. The page even says, "templates for rapid
interactive prototyping." Sounds like a perfect match for a rapid
framework like CakePHP.

You can download the file from my server:

Not to take you away from the Bakery or anything, but if you were so
inclined, you can see some screenshots on my site:

How do you use it? Look at the README in the zip file, but basically
you'll want to copy/merge the files in the same structure to your app.
Then when you go to bake your view templates you should have a
numbered option with "default" and "960grid" to choose from. Maybe
others too if you have more bake templates. Anyway, choose "960grid"
and that's it. You should be set.
