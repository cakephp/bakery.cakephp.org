CakePHP 2.10.0-RC1 Released
===========================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
2.10.0-RC1. This is a release candidate for 2.10.0, which is the *final* 2.x
feature release. We recommend anyone who would like to see a feature
added/backported to 2.x do so soon. Once 2.10 becomse stable we will not be
merging any new features, as 2.x will enter long term support.

Long Term Support
-----------------

As the final feature release for 2.x, we plan on supporting 2.x with:

* Bug fixes for *12 months* after the release of 4.0.0.
* Security fixes for *18 months* after the release of 4.0.0.

After that point, 2.x will become unmaintained and receive no further updates.

New Features
------------

2.10 adds several new community contributed features to 2.x. You can see the
`full list of features in the book
<https://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/appendices/2-10-migration-guide.html>`_.
