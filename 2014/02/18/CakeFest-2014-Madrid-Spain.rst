Workshops
~~~~~~~~~

The 2 day workshops at CakeFest are an ideal opportunity to learn the
internals of CakePHP, and a great way to get up to speed with the
latest version of the framework. We'll be focusing part of the
workshops on the new 3.0 code base, helping people get to grips with
the new features for this third major revision of CakePHP. Attendees
will also receive a personal certificate of attendance from the Cake
Software Foundation.

Conference
~~~~~~~~~~

The conference covers 2 jam packed days of keynotes, presentations,
discussions and talks on CakePHP and related technologies, plus an
array of activities, such as lightning talks, core team Q, the Hour of
Contribution and a raffle. It's a great time to engage and network
with the community, learn from other experienced developers, and party
with the core team. Plus, there will be cake!
