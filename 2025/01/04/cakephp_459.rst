CakePHP 4.5.9
==============

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
4.5.9. This is a maintenance release for the 4.5 branch that fixes a few
community reported issues and a security fix.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.5.9. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.5.8...4.5.9>`_ for every commit.

- Requests now read the uri from REQUEST_URI instead of PATH_INFO. PATH_INFO
  has urlescaping applied which enables requests with %2f to be routed when they
  should not. This could create a security risk for applications that use CDN or
  loadbalancer rules with paths to be bypassed.
- Fix ORM queries not being able to set read role.

Contributors to 4.5.9

Thank you to all the contributors that helped make this release happen:

- Jeppe Bonde Weikop for reporting the PATH_INFO issue.
