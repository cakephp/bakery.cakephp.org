CakePHP 2.2.7 released

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.2.7[1]. This is a bugfix release for the 2.2.x release
branch. After the release of 2.2.6 last week a regression was reported
for how select element and selected values were being handled. This
issue is now resolved, and 2.2.7 should be the final 2.2.x release
unless additional regressions are reported.

A big thanks to those involved in finding and fixing this issue.
