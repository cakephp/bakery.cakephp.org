CakePHP 5.2.7
==============

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
5.2.7. This is a maintenance release for the 5.2 branch that fixes several
community reported issues and regressions.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 5.2.7. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/5.2.6...5.2.7>`_ for every commit.

* Fixed regression where added rules were enabled for delete operations by
  default.
* Updated ``Validation::uuid()`` to accept V7 UUIDs.
* Fixed array value handling in ``getEnv()``.
* Fixed flaky tests for Arabic-Indic numeral output.
* Fixed hidden validation messages in nested entities from validation and domain
  rule failures. Now validation errors are available for nested entities in the
  ``_rule`` key.
* XML from ``Xml::fromArray()`` is now validated before being returned. This
  prevents invalid XML from being generated by invalid input. Now an
  ``XmlException`` will be thrown.
* Updated for PHP 8.5 deprecations.
* Cleaned up plugin configuration after test runs.
* Fixed column comment quoting in the MySQL schema dialect.
* Implemented missing support for ``QueryExpression`` as schema column defaults.
  This was a porting gap when moving code from migrations to cakephp/database.
