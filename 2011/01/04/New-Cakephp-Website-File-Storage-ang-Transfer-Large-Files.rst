New Cakephp Website : File Storage ang Transfer Large Files
===========================================================

In making this website flexibility and efficiency of use be developed,
I continuously work to make its navigation faster and more accessible
for you. Hence, I made this website into a file hub application. I
feel certain that this website is more valuable and useful compared to
the last one. It helps you store your files up to 2 GB free space
without time limit on archiving. The good thing here, if you have
files much bigger to the limit of your mailbox, you can use this
application to send those files and it's absolutely for FREE! However,
this application is still on beta version. There's still a lot to
expect these upcoming days. Thanks to Cakephp (Mark Story and the rest
of the team) and Croogo (Fahad). Both of them gave great contributions
in bringing this website live.
