Issues have moved to Github
===========================

The CakePHP team is happy to announce that as of today both issues and
pull requests will be managed at github.

The CakePHP team is happy to announce that as of today both issues and
pull requests will be managed at github. We have archived the
lighthouse projects and made them read-only. All open tickets from
lighthouse have been migrated to their respective github projects.
We'll be continuing to wrangle and update tickets in github over the
next few days. We'll also be updating the links on the various CakePHP
sites to reflect this change, and ask your patience while we get all
the information updated.


Why change?
-----------

While moving bug trackers is rarely a pleasant experience, we think
the move to github will be positive for the community. Since our move
to lighthouse in 2009, the ticket management features provided by
github have improved dramatically. With excellent search and tight
integration with pull requests we feel the ticketing features provided
by github now offer a number of advantages over lighthouse. We hope
that moving issues to github makes it easier and simpler for new and
existing contributors to continue making CakePHP a fantastic project.
We'd like to thank lighthouse for the excellent service and hosting
over the past 4 years.
